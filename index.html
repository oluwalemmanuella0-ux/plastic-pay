        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>
            Plastic Pay is an initiative designed to reduce plastic waste by encouraging
            people to pick up and deposit plastic in a Reverse Vending Machine (RVM).  
            Each deposit earns points on the Plastic Pay mobile app, and these points can be
            redeemed for amazing gifts and rewards.
